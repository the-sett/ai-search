# AI-Search

'ai-search' is an Elm package that provides a suite of search functions in the
Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) paradigm. See Part II on
Searching in 'Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach' published by Prentice
Hall (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) for a comprehensive guide to the theory.

# Get started

Example search problems can be found in the 'example/' folder. To run them in
the Elm reactor:

    cd example
    elm-reactor
