{-| Defines the possible outcomes of a search. A search may produce the following
results:

  - Complete. The search space has been exhausted without finding a goal state.
  - Goal. A goal state has been found. A function to find further results is also
    returned, in order that the search may be continued to find more goals.
  - Ongoing. A goal state has not been found yet. The state most recently examined
    is returned along with a function to continue to the search.

ones. This is how the graph over the search space is defined. The step function
takes a state and provides a list of other states that can be reached from it.
Each of the listed states is paired with a Bool that when true indiciates that
a state is considered to be a goal of the search.

the most promising nodes to follow, its memory requirements are lower than A-star.

completes an entire iteration, as when progressing depth first a less than optimal
solution may be found first within the current iteration. There is currently no way
to signal the completion of an iteration.
